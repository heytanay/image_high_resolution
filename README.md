# Image High Resolution

Autoencoders can be used to increase the quality of low resolution images, given sufficient training examples
In this Mini-project, I have used Faces in the Wild dataset (LFW) to convert a given low resolution image into a high resolution one.

In the current setting, the Dataset was small and so was the model architecture and the overrall image sizes, hence the fast training.

A saved model has been provided in this repository, that was trained for ~10.5 epochs and achieved a final Reconstruction loss of ~0.0020
